# PassKey Mobile Algorithm
PoC for unpredictable PassKeys using gyroscope and acceleration sensors


## Intro
This is a proof of concept for the passkey algorithm explained by the following white paper: XX

This code sample needs to be deployed on a mobile device because of the needed gyroscope and acceleration sensors.
If deployed on a stationary device it will fail.
