# PassKey Mobile Algorithm
PoC for unpredictable PassKeys using gyroscope and acceleration sensors of mobile devices.


## Intro
This is a proof of concept for the passkey algorithm explained by the following whitepaper: --

This code sample needs to be deployed on a mobile device because of the needed gyroscope and acceleration sensors.
If deployed on a stationary device the generated password wont be random enough.

This repos contains a proof of concept test html file to be deployed on a mobile phone to demonstrate the function.
